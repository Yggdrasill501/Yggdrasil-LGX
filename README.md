# Yggdrasil-LGX

It is a fork of https://github.com/Yggdrasil-LGX, but people aorund this didn't even started the project so I diceded to take it into my hands.
The Idea is to renew Yggdrasil-LGX linux which was one of the first linux distro out there.

# Kernel and Features 
I'm planning to use pack-man as package manager
And Arch Kernel but with bit different config.
